# Node.js-User-Authentication-System-with-MongoDB-and-Express
Project Description
This project is a user authentication API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides secure user registration and login functionality, password hashing, and basic error handling. This setup can serve as a foundation for more complex authentication systems in web applications.

Features
User Registration: Create an account with username, email, and password.
User Login: Authenticate users with email and password verification.
Password Hashing: Uses bcrypt to securely store passwords.
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages for invalid input or database issues.

Technology Stack
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for backend development.
Express: Lightweight web framework for handling routes.
MongoDB: Database for user data storage.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB, for schema-based data modeling.
bcrypt: Password hashing for security.
EJS: Template engine to render HTML login and registration pages.
